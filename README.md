# Tetris-Game
Fun Implementation of the Classic Tetris Game using an Arduino Uno to power an arcade-like game board. Pictures of the final project are viewable in the Game-Board-Pictures folder.

## Getting Started

Due to this game having a large Hardware Component, it will be difficult to replicate the game board.

## Some Specifics

Tetris!

Implements the game of tetris with slight modifications to classic NES rules on a 210 LED array.

This game makes use of the FastLED library v3.2.1 to output to the WS2812B LEDs used in our array.
